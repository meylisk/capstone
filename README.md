# Capstone Project

My final capstone project at BrainStation Data Science Diploma Program (June 2020).

This project will analyze the used car dataset, acquired from Kaggle, and will attempt to build a machine learning model to correctly  predict the prices of cars.   



This project package consists of the following files:

1. "Meylis_Capstone_capstone.ipynb" - this notebook includes all cleaning and EDA steps, and also modelling of 10 ScikitLearn ML models and 1 XGBoost model.

2. "Meylis_Capstone_capstone_colab.ipynb" - this notebook was run on Google Colab space, and it includes same cleaning and EDA steps as in the first notebook, but has 2 Neural Network models. 

3. "capstone_env.yml" and "capstone_env.txt" - project conda environment - all the packages needed to run the jupyter notebooks. If you want to run those jupyter notebooks and you don't have some of the packages, eg XGBoost, then you might want to install this conda environment.

Please note, that due to the size of the dataset file (1.4gb csv file, or 350mb zip file), it was not included in this package. If you would like to access it, you can download it from Kaggle, at https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data
The file I have used for this project is version 5, created and uploaded in Feb 2020.
